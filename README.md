# Computer-Vision
A beginner's introduction to Neural Netwroks. Four case studies on the MNIST dataset
## Abstract
Neural networks are becoming more and more important since the past ten years. Their impact
on many applications - where state of the art software or algorithms were used - has been huge.
Especially, their impact was very important in the field of computer vision, where there have
been thousands and thousand of researches carries on by many people all around the world.
However, having a complete and fully understanding view of how they work is yet not very
simple. Aim of these four case studies is to give the reader the chance of understanding the
working principle of neural networks and their mechanism (chapter one). Then, we will discuss
about the importance of data and the impact that this aspect may have on the performances
(chapter 2). After that we will have a quick look to a special -and yet very interesting- type
of Neural Networks like GAN (chapter 3) and at the very end we will discuss about possible
problems related to the "safety" aspects of NN (chapter 4).
As a final remark, these notes are the results of five month of research period at Tohoku
university, where I attended with interest the course of computer vision. As a consequence,
discussions and results may not be the most accurate ever, but they are meant to demonstrate
the potential that neural networks can achieve.
